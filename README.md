# JavaScript Null and Undefined Comparison Bug

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to loose equality comparisons involving `null` and `undefined`.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected version.

## Problem

JavaScript's loose equality (`==`) can produce unexpected results when comparing against `null` and `undefined`.  This can lead to subtle errors and unexpected behavior in your code.

## Solution

The best solution is to explicitly check for `null` and `undefined` using strict equality (`===`) or the appropriate conditional logic.  This eliminates ambiguity and makes the code more readable and robust.
